Samples for PayPal .NET SDK ported to .Net Standard
===========================

This is not a whole sample, but most of the pieces of code required to make the paypal payment work.
Example: The PayPalService class requires a DbContext, which is not provided in the sample. 
The sample has not been tested, but extracted from a working project.
